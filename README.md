The ESCs are connected to their respective 4 pins M1, M2, M3, and M4 on the KK board. The receiver is then attached to the KK board. Four channels are used in the receiver for the four different movements and are connected to their respective pins namely the throttle, elevator, aileron, and rudder pins. Only one of the pin pairs is made in connection to the Vcc and Gnd pins and the remaining three are connected via signal pins. The KK board is an inbuilt microprocessor that gives out the desired output to the motors by receiving the signals for the different movements via the receiver.
